    <p>we were never caught</p>

<p>we partied the southwest, smoked it from L.A. to El Dorado   <br />
worked odd jobs between delusions of escape  <br />
drunk on the admonitions of parents, parsons &amp; professors   <br />
driving faster than the road or law allowed.   <br />
our high-pitched laughter was young, heartless &amp; disrespected   <br />
authority. we could be heard for miles in the night</p>

<p>the Grand Canyon of a new manhood.  <br />
womanhood discovered  <br />
like the first sighting of Mount Wilson</p>

<p>we rebelled against the southwestern wind</p>

<p>we got so naturally ripped, we sprouted wings,    <br />
crashed parties on the moon, and howled at the earth</p>

<p>we lived off love. It was all we had to eat</p>

<p>when you split you took all the wisdom  <br />
and left me the worry</p>
